# Introduction

This project aims to create a collaborative markdown editor for the web. This is a work in progress, a passion project, and also a project for me to learn cool technologies.

## Development Phases

Outlining the different releases and tasks to focus on:

1. 2-column layout, left side is for users to enter content and edit their markdown, right side is to preview said content
2. Button to copy markdown content
3. User authentication and authorization (new backend repository)
4. Add a collapsible sidebar on the left to have multiple documents
5. Collaboration feature
